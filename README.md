# viRz
  viRz is yet another algorithms visualizer, written in Java.  
  It generates random (but constrained) input data then operates on them, check [Visualizer.java](src/Visualizer.java)  
  Visualization is done using a modified version of [StdDraw](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/StdDraw.java.html)  
  Project is under development and is made for education, training and fun.
